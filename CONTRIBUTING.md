# Contributing to the Lab GitHub Site

This particular repository just redirects to the 
[docs](ihttps://github.com/CisnerosResearch/docs) repo for now, 
but there may eventually be a need/wish for a landing page.

## Web Accessibility

If this becomes a real site and not just a redirect,
**PLEASE** make sure it has
passed an accessibility check.
There are some things in the template that we're working on (all those 
empty labels...).
But things like alt text and Aria labels are mandatory.
Also, please consider whether any linked content is appropriately captioned.
